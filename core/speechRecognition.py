    The SpeechRecognition class provides a method for speech recognition using the Google Speech Recognition API. 
    Here is a summary of each class method:

    - recognize_speech: Recognizes speech using the Google Speech Recognition API. 
    It returns a tuple with a boolean value indicating success or failure of speech recognition, and a string representing the recognized speech. 
    It can raise UnknownValueError if the speech cannot be understood, or RequestError if there is an error with the speech recognition request.

    - __is_connect_internet: Checks if the device is connected to the internet. 
    It returns a boolean value indicating whether the device is connected to the internet or not.
